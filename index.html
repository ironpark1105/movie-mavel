      <h1>CAPTION-MAVEL</h1>
      <p>Former Air Force pilot and intelligence agent Carol Danvers pursued her dream of space exploration as a NASA
        employee, but her life forever changed when she was accidentally transformed into a human-Kree hybrid with
        extraordinary powers.
        <br><br>
        Now, Carol is the latest warrior to embrace the mantle of Captain Marvel, and she has taken her place as one of
        the world’s mightiest heroes.
      </p>
      <h2>Higher, Further, Faster, More</h2>
      <p>As a NASA security officer, Carol investigated numerous attempts made by the Kree and Skrulls to infiltrate
        Kennedy Space Center and disrupt America’s space program. During a battle between the heroic Mar-Vell and his
        rival, Yon-Rogg, Carol was exposed to the Psyche-Magnitron, a Kree device that could make imagination into
        reality. Carol subconsciously envied Mar-Vell’s powers, and the machine responded to those desires by rewriting
        her DNA to make her a human/Kree hybrid with abilities similar to his.
        <br><br>
        Carol took on the identity of Ms. Marvel and even fought alongside Mar-Vell/Captain Marvel and the Avengers. Her
        early career was cut short when Rogue, a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, attacked Carol and
        permanently drained her powers and memories. It took years for Carol to recover from her ordeal, but she finally
        achieved her dream of space exploration and traveled far from Earth. Carol even became cosmically empowered and
        took on the codename Binary.
        <br><br>
        The Binary powers faded over time, leaving Carol with most of her original abilities. Carol returned to Earth
        and rejoined the Avengers. Years later, Carol adopted the codename Captain Marvel as a tribute to her fallen
        friend and mentor. Her prominence has also grown exponentially, and Captain Marvel is now the most popular
        heroine in the world.

      <h1>BLACK-WIDOW</h1>
      <h2>Enigma</h2>
      <p>
        Natasha Romanoff was trained from a young age to cultivate a very specific set of skills in a Russian facility
        called the Red Room. There she honed the skills that would turn her into a human warrior who continues to stand
        shoulder-to-shoulder with super soldiers, Asgardians and people in armored suits. However, she eventually
        eschewed her KGB masters, switched allegiances and began working for the good guys.
      </p>
      <h2>Trained by the Best</h2>
      <p>
        Exhibiting no super human abilities, the Black Widow boasts ultimate human levels of strength, agility, and
        stamina. She is extensively trained to near perfection in a variety of fighting styles, such as karate, judo,
        kung fu, and wrestling, and with all manner of weapons—both traditional and high-tech—combined with her
        background in gymnastics, acrobatics, and ballet to always accomplish her mission.
        <br><br>
        She can use a simple handgun just as well as a Chitauri battle staff or even Captain America's shield. Her
        signature weapons include dual batons, a pair of Glock 26s and the Black Widow’s Bite—bracelets that discharge
        electricity. Romanoff also displays great skill when it comes to hacking in computers and technological systems
        to dig for information or regaining control.

      <h1>THANOS</h1>
      <h2>For Death’s Sake</h2>
      <p>A native of the planet Titan, Thanos saw the danger his people were in from overpopulation and suggested a
        severe solution—the elimination of half the population, at random and without prejudice, in order to make life
        better for the planet as a whole. He was shunned as a madman, but his planet did indeed eventually die, lacking
        the resources needed to keep up with the demands.
        <br><br>
        Firmly believing that the universe at large was in the same danger as Titan, Thanos grew to power as a force
        bringing death and destruction from planet to planet, with untold legions of soldiers and servants at his beck
        and call. Infamous for annihilating entire races in service of depopulating what he believes to be an
        overcrowded universe, he most often works through surrogates to achieve his goals, but has been known to take a
        personal hand in special circumstances.
        <br><br>
        More than once, Thanos took a child from a galactic species he’d decimated and raised them as his own. Some of
        these children have been tutored in the arts of assassination and war, making them among the deadliest killers
        imaginable. Thanos has also given powerful artifacts to individuals who he believes will use them to spread the
        cause of death in certain important spots among the galaxies.
        <br><br>
        Thanos went on to have a great interest in acquiring the Infinity Stones, six objects of immense power scattered
        throughout the universe, and has had the Infinity Gauntlet built in order to harness their power.

      <h1>IRON-MAN</h1>
      <h2>Cool Exec</h2>
      <p>Genius inventor Tony Stark continued his father Howard Stark’s weaponry business after his parents’ untimely
        deaths and flew it to even greater heights of innovation. While in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new missile for
        the U.S. military, Stark’s convoy came under fire by a terrorist group known as the Ten Rings and he was
        severely wounded. Taken prisoner by the group, Stark awoke in their headquarters to learn that shrapnel near his
        heart had nearly cost him his life, but swift action by scientist and fellow prisoner Ho Yinsen—who had inserted
        a powerful electromagnet in Stark’s chest—would prolong it temporarily.
        <br><br>
        Stalling his captors after they demanded he build them a new weapon, Stark replaced the magnet with the RT, a
        miniature version of a device originally designed by his father, the Arc Reactor. Furthermore, he and Yinsen
        created a crude suit of armor which could provide them the means with which to escape. The suit worked as
        planned, though Yinsen sacrificed himself in order to allow Tony enough time to power it up to fight their
        terrorist captors.
